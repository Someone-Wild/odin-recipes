    <h1>Feta and Tomato Pasta</h1>

        <h2>This fresh and aromatic dish is sure to become a staple of your at home cooking.</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of those go to's for me. It is sure to make the whole house smell
            good while cooking, and that only makes the end result that much more enjoyable.
            The combonation of feta, cherry tomatoes, garlic, and olive oil always makes a house 
            smell alive. Fresh ingredients are best, but even on a tighter budget this dish is sure
            to make your mouth water!
        </p>

        <p>This may not appear to be the healthiest dish ever, and I'll be honest, its not the <em> best</em>
        but it sure is close enough. Depending on your pasta choice the whole dish can be gluten free
    on top of it already being vegetarian. It is a very simple dish to scale up or
    down depending on how many poeple are going to be enjoying this dish. 
    This feeds more than you might realize, so be prepared
to pack some away for the next few days.</p>
