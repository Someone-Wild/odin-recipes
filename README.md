Recipes page practice
This is going to be my first attempt at doing a baisic html website ground up. The goal here is to not have to google too many things, use the notes I've written down to help the most. After this project I hope to have a better grasp on how to make proper links, organize my files in my repositories, and have clear, concise code others could easily read.
